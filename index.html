                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Background</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">Section 13(8)(b) of the IGST Act currently specifies that for intermediary services, the place of supply is deemed to be the location of the service provider. This creates complications in cross-border transactions involving intermediaries (like brokers, agents, commission agents, sale reps and alike etc) resulting in tax challenges and disputes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Recommended Change</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">The 56th GST Council proposed the omission of Section 13(8)(b), so the place of supply for intermediary services will now be the location of the service recipient. This amendment aligns the law with the destination principle of GST.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Impact on Indian Intermediaries</h3>
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>Indian intermediaries supplying services to foreign clients will now have the place of supply deemed as outside India (location of recipient).</li>
                        <li>These intermediary services will be classified as export of services for GST purposes.</li>
                        <li>Exports are zero-rated, so Indian intermediaries will not pay GST on such supplies.</li>
                        <li>They will be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) and refunds on GST paid on inputs / input services / capital goods (if any) used to supply these services.</li>
                        <li>This change improves competitiveness for Indian service providers as intermediaries in global markets and provides much-needed tax relief.</li>

                    <h3 class="section-title">A. Law Changes in Section 15(3) and Section 34</h3>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Background of the Issue</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">The issue with the existing provisions of the CGST Act related to post-sale discounts arises primarily from the stringent conditions imposed under Section 15(3)(b)(i). Currently, to deduct a post-sale discount from the value of supply for GST purposes, the discount must be established by a pre-supply agreement and specifically linked to invoices. This has created practical difficulties for businesses, as post-sale discounts are often given after the supply is completed and may not always have a formal pre-agreed condition tied to invoices, leading to ambiguity and disputes.</p>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">The problem is compounded by the requirement under Section 15(3)(b)(ii) that the recipient must reverse the Input Tax Credit (ITC) attributable to the discount. Ensuring compliance with this provision has been administratively complex, requiring mechanisms such as Circular No. 212/6/2024-GST, which imposed burdens on both suppliers and recipients to prove ITC reversal, thus creating recurring compliance difficulties and disputes.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Proposed Changes as Recommended by GST Council</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">The change proposed by the GST Council includes:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li><strong>Omission of Section 15(3)(b)(i)</strong> to remove the prerequisite of a pre-supply agreement and explicit invoice linking for granting post-sale discounts. This simplification aligns the law more closely with commercial realities where discounts may be decided after supply.</li>
                        <li><strong>Amendment of Section 15(3)(b)</strong> to mandate that discounts must be granted through a credit note issued under Section 34. This formalizes the post-sale discount through a standardized instrument (credit note), ensuring transparency and better audit trails.</li>
                        <li><strong>Corresponding amendment of Section 34</strong> to explicitly refer to Section 15(3)(b), making it clear that when a credit note reduces the value of supply, the recipient must reverse the proportional ITC. This eliminates ambiguity over ITC reversal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rescission of Circular No. 212/6/2024-GST</strong> that imposed compliance mechanisms for ITC reversal, as the amendments will provide a clearer, streamlined framework.</li>

                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Background</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">Currently, under Section 54(6) of the CGST Act, 2017, provisional refunds of 90% of the claimed amount are allowed for zero-rated supplies.

                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Issue</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">Currently, under Section 54(14) of the CGST Act, 2017, there exists a threshold limit of Rs. 1000 for claiming GST refunds on exports made with payment of tax. This provision poses a challenge for small exporters who make exports via low-value consignments, such as courier or postal shipments, where refund amounts often fall below this threshold. As a result, these exporters face difficulty in claiming timely and full GST refunds, impacting their cash flow and international competitiveness.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Proposed Recommendation for Amendment in Law</h4>
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>The GST Council has recommended an amendment to remove the threshold limit in Section 54(14) for refunds arising from exports made with payment of tax.</li>
                        <li>There will no longer be a minimum claim amount requirement for refund of GST on export consignments.</li>
                        <li>Refunds will become accessible for all export transactions regardless of refund amount, enabling small exporters and MSMEs using courier or postal modes to claim refunds without restriction.</li>
                        <li>The amendment aims to facilitate ease of doing business, improve cash flow for smaller exporters, and boost their participation in cross-border trade.</li>

                    <p class="section-text">Parliament, while introducing GST, inserted a unique consumer-protection mechanism: the anti-profiteering provision under Section 171 of the CGST Act, 2017.</p>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">The essence of this provision is simple but stringent: if the government reduces the GST rate on goods or services, or extends the benefit of ITC, such benefit must be passed on to the recipient by way of a commensurate reduction in price.</p>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">With the 56th GST Council historic deliberation on rate rationalisation has been done and industries are again anxious.</p>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">As GST rates have reduced, businesses are wondering whether they may come under renewed scrutiny for profiteering as past experience shows that even inadvertent failures to update MRPs, contracts, or tariffs have led to severe penalties.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Statutory Basis</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">Section 171(1) of the CGST Act mandates:</p>
                    <p class="section-text"><em>"Any reduction in the rate of tax on any supply of goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices."</em></p>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">Sub-section (2) authorised the constitution of an authority to monitor compliance, while sub-section (3A) provided for penalties in the case of contravention.</p>
                    
                    <p class="section-text">The provision is intentionally broad. It does not prescribe a fixed methodology for determining "commensurate reduction," leaving room for disputes but also enabling flexibility across industries.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Sunset Clause on Anti-Profiteering</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">Importantly, a sunset clause from April 1, 2025 now prevents new complaints, though pending cases continue.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Whether Anti Profiteering provisions have been brought back?</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">No, Anti Profiteering have not been brought back. The industry is expected to decide prices basis the demand and supply. The previous experience of Government suggests that Industry had passed on the benefit of the reduced GST Rates. Thus greater reliance has been placed on the self-regulation only.</p>

                        <li><strong>a.</strong> Duty Inversion Increases due to which the IDS refund cases increases. But there is no refund of input services and capital goods. It creates the position of blocking of working capital</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>b.</strong> Situation of shifting goods / services from taxable to exempted category breaks the flow of ITC and due to this reason the complete benefit of reduced GST Rate is not passed to the customer as the ITC which was earlier creditable now becomes a cost</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>c.</strong> The refunds under automatic route for export of goods reduced in case of reduce in rate of GST on goods. Now due to said reason the refund of accumulated ITC under LUT mode may increase. But that hampers the calculation of refund under inverted duty structure.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>d.</strong> Due to change in rate of tax on goods, now with reduced rates, the situation of refund of ITC accumulation due to inverted duty arises. However due to para 3 of circular no 135/05/2020 dated 31.03.2020 is not allowed. Same is in contradiction of decision in case of M/s BMG Informatics Pvt Ltd vs UOI- 2021-TIOL-1831-HC-Gaw-GST. Thus it leads to blocking of working capital and litigation.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>e.</strong> Demands for goods have dried and the movement of goods in transit has stopped and fresh orders are also on hold in all those cases where GST Rates are recommended to be reduced with effect from 22nd September 2025. Goods can be now sold on approval basis and as and when the sale proceeds are realized by the distributor, the sale invoice for such goods sent on approval can be issued.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>f.</strong> Implementation of GST Rates with no ITC makes the supply of goods or services costly. Same would the situation in case of Hotels having value of supply less than Rs 7500 or wellness services like Yoga, SPA etc. It is against the spirit of GST i.e. it is a value added tax.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>g.</strong> Accumulation of Cess with Automobile sector will cause increase in cost. It will be passed on to customer in short to medium term if refund or set off of accumulated compensation cess is not allowed. It will lead to situation of increased litigation.</li>

                            <p class="section-text">
                                The recent recommendation to move a number of consumer-facing services to a 5% GST slab without ITC, on paper this looks like a tax cut for consumers, but in practice the denial of ITC creates a significant and measurable downside for suppliers.
                            </p>
                            <p class="section-text">
                                <strong>Economic Impact:</strong> ITC denial causes tax cascading: taxes paid on inputs (food ingredients, beverages, consumables, imported or domestic equipment, utilities, outsourced laundry and cleaning, packaging, and other vendor services) cannot be offset against output liability and therefore become part of the supplier's cost base. That embedded tax then flows into menu prices or membership fees, often offsetting, and in some cases exceeding, the benefit of the lower headline rate.
                            </p>
                            <p class="section-text">
                                <strong>Operational Impact:</strong> The shift to 5% without ITC generates immediate cash-flow and pricing consequences. Suppliers must now front GST paid on purchases out of working capital rather than recover it; many smaller operators will therefore need to reforecast cash requirements and, where necessary, arrange short-term working capital. For pricing decisions, businesses should run menu-level unit economics under the new regime: show (i) current effective cost and margin with any ITC historically claimed and (ii) new effective cost and margin with 5% and no ITC, making the cascading amount explicit. Only after this exercise can management decide whether to absorb the tax, increase prices, introduce service or packaging fees, or redesign product offerings.

                            <h5 class="note-title">B. "Specified Premises" Clarification</h5>
                            <p class="section-text">
                                The Council has recommended clarifying the definition of "specified premises" with an Explanation to remove ambiguity: a stand-alone restaurant cannot declare itself to be a "specified premises" and therefore cannot choose the 18% with ITC option that is available to restaurants located within hotels where the room tariff for the unit exceeds √¢‚Äö¬π7,500 per day.
                            </p>
                            <p class="section-text">
                                This clarification was made to stop misuse of the "specified premises" route and to ensure that only restaurants genuinely integrated within high-tariff hotel premises continue to access the 18%+ITC treatment. For businesses, this means the location/association test matters practically; restaurants inside qualifying hotels retain their previous ITC route, but standalone outlets (including newly registered ones) must accept 5% without ITC and cannot lawfully reclassify to obtain ITC by self-declaration.
                            </p>
                            <p class="section-text">
                                <strong>Effective Date:</strong> This change came into focus from 1st April 2025 and has been recommended to be clarified in the 56th GST Council meeting, effective 22nd September 2025.

                        <p class="faq-answer">The said issue has been clarified vide circular No. 135/05/2020-GST dated 31.03.2020 (as amended), which states that refund of accumulated ITC in terms of clause (ii) of first proviso to section 54(3) of the CGST Act, is available where the credit has accumulated on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies. However, the input and output being the same in such cases, though attracting different tax rates at different points in time, do not get covered under the provisions of clause (ii) of the first proviso to sub-section (3) of section 54 of the CGST Act.</p>

Fully exempting small tractors would be counterproductive. When the rate of tax on any goods is nil, the suppliers cannot claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) on the inputs used in manufacture of the goods and will have to reverse the same. This means that the producers have to absorb this cost which will eventually be passed to the buyers.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">The special rate is applicable only on few select goods, predominantly on sin goods and few luxury goods and therefore is a special rate. Most of these goods attracted Compensation Cess in addition to GST.

On other goods and services, the special rate has been applied as these were already attracting the highest GST rate of 28%.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">Currently, cotton attracts GST on reverse charge basis. This means that agriculturists do not have to pay GST when they supply raw cotton. The reason for taxing cotton in GST is to avoid breakage in input credit chain and the GST paid on cotton is available as input tax credit for the textile industry.

                        <p class="faq-answer">The aim of the rate rationalisation exercise is to correct inversion in the manmade value chain. This is in line with the fibre neutral policy. However, the listed items are multi use goods.

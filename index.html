                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Background</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">Section 13(8)(b) of the IGST Act currently specifies that for intermediary services, the place of supply is deemed to be the location of the service provider. This creates complications in cross-border transactions involving intermediaries (like brokers, agents, commission agents, sale reps and alike etc) resulting in tax challenges and disputes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Recommended Change</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">The 56th GST Council proposed the omission of Section 13(8)(b), so the place of supply for intermediary services will now be the location of the service recipient. This amendment aligns the law with the destination principle of GST.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Impact on Indian Intermediaries</h3>
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>Indian intermediaries supplying services to foreign clients will now have the place of supply deemed as outside India (location of recipient).</li>
                        <li>These intermediary services will be classified as export of services for GST purposes.</li>
                        <li>Exports are zero-rated, so Indian intermediaries will not pay GST on such supplies.</li>
                        <li>They will be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) and refunds on GST paid on inputs / input services / capital goods (if any) used to supply these services.</li>
                        <li>This change improves competitiveness for Indian service providers as intermediaries in global markets and provides much-needed tax relief.</li>

                        <li>Foreign intermediaries providing services to Indian recipients were earlier not subject to GST because the place of supply was their own foreign location.</li>
                        <li>Post-omission, the place of supply will be India (location of the recipient).</li>
                        <li>Such services will be classified as "import of services" and attract GST under reverse charge mechanism payable by Indian recipients.</li>
                        <li>Indian recipients will pay GST but can claim input tax credit or refunds (in case of zero rated supplies), ensuring tax neutrality.</li>
                        <li>This means foreign intermediaries' services to India will be taxable but fully creditable/refundable within the Indian GST system.</li>

                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Purpose</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">This amendment aims to facilitate and expedite refund claims for zero-rated supplies while incorporating a risk-based assessment system to mitigate fraudulent claims. The detailed scrutiny option preserves the authority's ability to thoroughly check claims when necessary.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Mechanism</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">The (GST) Council has recommended an amendment in rule 91(2) of the CGST Rules, 2017 regarding the sanction of provisional refunds related to zero-rated supplies, which include export of goods or services or supplies to a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) developer/unit for authorized operations.</p>

                        <li>Provisional refund will be sanctioned to the extent of 90% of the refund claimed by the registered person.</li>
                        <li>The legal provision are already contained in Section 54(6) of the CGST Act 2017. However the Rule 91 of the CGST Rules 2017 was not aligned.</li>
                        <li>The sanction of this provisional refund will be done by the proper officer based on the identification and evaluation of risk by a system.</li>
                        <li>In exceptional cases, the proper officer may choose, with reasons recorded in writing, to bypass provisional refund and proceed with detailed scrutiny of the refund claim.</li>
                        <li>A notification will be issued to specify certain categories of registered persons who will not be eligible for provisional refunds.</li>

                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Purpose</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">To improve the timely disbursal of refund claims related to IDS by facilitating taxpayers claiming refunds on account of inverted duty structure to be eligible for provisional refund of 90% of the claimed amount subject to risk-based evaluation by GST authorities, even before the amendment to the law is formally done.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Background</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">Currently, under Section 54(6) of the CGST Act, 2017, provisional refunds of 90% of the claimed amount are allowed for zero-rated supplies. However, such provisional refunds are not explicitly extended to refunds arising from the inverted duty structure (IDS).</p>

                    <p class="section-text">To amend Section 54(6) of the CGST Act to allow sanction of 90% of the refund claimed on a provisional basis in cases arising out of inverted duty structure, similar to the treatment for zero-rated supply refunds.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Government Decision for stop-gap arrangement</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">Pending formal amendments to the CGST Act, the Central Government has directed Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) to issue instructions to Central Tax field formations for granting provisional refunds of 90% of the claimed amount arising out of IDS refunds.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Mechanism</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">The provisional refunds will be granted based on risk identification and evaluation by the system, similar to the existing process followed for provisional refunds on zero-rated supplies.</p>

                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Issue</h4>
                    <p class="section-text">Currently, under Section 54(14) of the CGST Act, 2017, there exists a threshold limit of Rs. 1000 for claiming GST refunds on exports made with payment of tax. This provision poses a challenge for small exporters who make exports via low-value consignments, such as courier or postal shipments, where refund amounts often fall below this threshold. As a result, these exporters face difficulty in claiming timely and full GST refunds, impacting their cash flow and international competitiveness.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Proposed Recommendation for Amendment in Law</h4>
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>The GST Council has recommended an amendment to remove the threshold limit in Section 54(14) for refunds arising from exports made with payment of tax.</li>
                        <li>There will no longer be a minimum claim amount requirement for refund of GST on export consignments.</li>
                        <li>Refunds will become accessible for all export transactions regardless of refund amount, enabling small exporters and MSMEs using courier or postal modes to claim refunds without restriction.</li>
                        <li>The amendment aims to facilitate ease of doing business, improve cash flow for smaller exporters, and boost their participation in cross-border trade.</li>

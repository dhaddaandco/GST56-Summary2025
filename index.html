            <h2 class="content-title">Omission of Section 13(8)(b) of IGST Act: Impact on Indian and Foreign Intermediaries</h2>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Background</h3>
                <p class="section-text">Section 13(8)(b) of the IGST Act currently specifies that for intermediary services, the place of supply is deemed to be the location of the service provider, regardless of where the actual service is consumed or where the recipient is located.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Recommended Change</h3>
                <p class="section-text">The 56th GST Council proposed the omission of Section 13(8)(b), so the place of supply for intermediary services will now be the location of the service recipient, aligning with the general rule for services.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Impact on Indian Intermediaries</h3>
                <ul class="impact-list">
                    <li>Indian intermediaries supplying services to foreign clients will now have the place of supply deemed as outside India (location of recipient).</li>
                    <li>These intermediary services will be classified as export of services for GST purposes.</li>
                    <li>Exports are zero-rated, so Indian intermediaries will not pay GST on such supplies.</li>
                    <li>They will be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) and refunds for taxes paid on inputs used in providing these services.</li>
                    <li>This change improves competitiveness of Indian intermediaries in the global market by reducing their tax burden.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Impact on Foreign Intermediaries</h3>
                <ul class="impact-list">
                    <li>Foreign intermediaries providing services to Indian recipients were earlier not subject to GST due to the place of supply being deemed as outside India.</li>
                    <li>With the omission of Section 13(8)(b), the place of supply will now be the location of the Indian recipient.</li>
                    <li>This means foreign intermediaries will now be liable to pay GST on services provided to Indian clients.</li>
                    <li>They will need to register under GST and comply with Indian tax laws for such transactions.</li>
                    <li>This change ensures a level playing field between Indian and foreign intermediaries.</li>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Background</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">Section 13(8)(b) of the IGST Act currently specifies that for intermediary services, the place of supply is deemed to be the location of the service provider. This creates complications in cross-border transactions involving intermediaries (like brokers, agents, commission agents, sale reps and alike etc) resulting in tax challenges and disputes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Recommended Change</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">The 56th GST Council proposed the omission of Section 13(8)(b), so the place of supply for intermediary services will now be the location of the service recipient. This amendment aligns the law with the destination principle of GST.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Impact on Indian Intermediaries</h3>
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>Indian intermediaries supplying services to foreign clients will now have the place of supply deemed as outside India (location of recipient).</li>
                        <li>These intermediary services will be classified as export of services for GST purposes.</li>
                        <li>Exports are zero-rated, so Indian intermediaries will not pay GST on such supplies.</li>
                        <li>They will be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) and refunds on GST paid on inputs / input services / capital goods (if any) used to supply these services.</li>
                        <li>This change improves competitiveness for Indian service providers as intermediaries in global markets and provides much-needed tax relief.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Impact on Foreign Intermediaries</h3>
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>Foreign intermediaries providing services to Indian recipients were earlier not subject to GST because the place of supply was their own foreign location.</li>
                        <li>Post-omission, the place of supply will be India (location of the recipient).</li>
                        <li>Such services will be classified as "import of services" and attract GST under reverse charge mechanism payable by Indian recipients.</li>
                        <li>Indian recipients will pay GST but can claim input tax credit or refunds (in case of zero rated supplies), ensuring tax neutrality.</li>
                        <li>This means foreign intermediaries' services to India will be taxable but fully creditable/refundable within the Indian GST system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>The amendment proposal was accepted in the 56th GST Council meeting.</li>
                        <li>The proposed amendment required amendment in law and hence would require Parliament's approval followed by President assent and subsequent notification for effective date of implementation.</li>
